# justchatting.io Frontend
This project is in it's early alpha phase where I have prototypes of working tools but need to build all the other stuff around it to make it public (auth, logging, performance improvements, better UI etc).

This repo will contain the code that will communicate with the backend server

# What is justchatting.io?
The plan is to make a set of tools to help when working with live streams. It will help streamers, content creators (such as editors) and viewers work with live streams and VODs. It came about after I started editing for Twitch streamer jnic. I found that finding good clips in 5 hour long streams was not efficient so I made some tools to analyse chat to find key moments in the stream.

After having a few ideas for more tools and features, I decided I'd like to make this publicly accessible and open source.

# Can I contribute?
As soon as I start making a start on development, I will happily allow people to contribute to the project. This is my first open source project so will accept any feedback to make things better

# Want to get in touch?
I am planning on setting up a Discord server once I have started development. For now, you can DM me on Discord (MrDarrenGriffin#8825) or Twitter (@MrDarrenGriffin)
